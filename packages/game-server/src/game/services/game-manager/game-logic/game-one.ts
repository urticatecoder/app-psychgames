/**
 * Implements the "game one" scenario as follows:
 * - All players begin at position 0.
 * - Players select some number of players (other than themselves) to move upwards.
 * - If a doublet/triplet of players picking each other are formed, the doublet/triplet
 *  gets bonus movement on top of the normal movement.
 * - At the end of each round, the player positions are normalized by subtracting the average
 *  movement from each player position. This implies that the average player position is always 0.
 * - When the players have been separated into the winning and losing positions, the game ends.
 *
 * NOTE: The movements are not fair or predictable; the objective of this game is to separate players
 * into winners and losers. To do this while preventing stalemate, the game will progressively add noise
 * and bias into the movements.
