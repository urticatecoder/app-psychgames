     * Generate player IDs
     *
     * Why do we generate player IDs here?
     * If we had `addPlayer()` and `removePlayer()` functions to
     * add/remove player IDs, we would have to keep track of bots vs
     * humans, generate bot IDs at an appropriate time, and the logic
     * to change players mid-game would be difficult since player IDs need
     * to be consistent for state purposes.
     *
     * Instead of doing this, we generate IDs at game initialization, and
     * allow server connections to attach/detach from a specific ID.
     *
     * This introduces a minor security risk; namely, if we change a player
     * mid-game, the old client still has the ID of the new player. This is
     * not especially relevant because:
     * - We currently don't even support mid-game player changes
     * - As long as we don't allow two players with the same ID to connect at
     *   once, the old player won't be able to initiate a connection while the
     *   old player is playing
     * - Allowing an old player to join in if the new one disconnects might even
     *   be beneficial behavior
     *
     * Note that replacing players mid-game breaks the consistency between ID
     * and player metadata. Keep this in mind during feature implementation.
     * We would probably only want to support player replacement during random
     * lobbies with no player metadata.
