At the end of each turn, players move up or down the screen. 
These movements aredetermined by:
The amount of times the player has been chosen by other players.
Cooperation bonuses (described in detail below), the player’s current position–
players closer to the top will find it easier to move upward.
Luck–sometimes you will travel greater distances upward.
or downward, simply by chance.
In this game, individuals who choose each other will tend to move up and perform better overall.
