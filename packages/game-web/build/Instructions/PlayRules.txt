You can move between players with the arrow keys and select them using the spacebar key. 
When you are done choosing these recipient players, you may click ‘End Turn’ to confirm your selection.
If you decide to choose none of them, you may just click ‘End Turn’. 
Pressing the space key over an already-selected player will reverse the decision.
The turn will conclude once every player in the room clicks on the ‘End Turn’ button.
