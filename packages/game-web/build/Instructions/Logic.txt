On every turn you will be able to choose up to two other players.
At the end of the turn the players you have chosen will move a little closer to the top. 
The other players will similarly be choosing others to travel upwards. 
The turn ends when everyone has finished choosing. 
Bonuses (described later) will also be awarded at the end of the turn.
