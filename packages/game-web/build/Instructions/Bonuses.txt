The largest upward bonus will be given to triplets who all chose each other.
If you and two other players choose each other, a purple line connecting each player will be shown at the conclusion of the turn (and before the next turn begins).
There will be a smaller bonus of upward travel distance given to pair of players who choose each other.
Note that for any bonus, you will onlyget to see links involving yourself (and not those of other players). 
Finally, after you see the types of links above, you will be shown individual movements of each player.
A green line will be displayed if that player had chosen you on the previous trial.
