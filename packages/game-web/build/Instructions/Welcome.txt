Welcome to the study!

In this first part, you and the other participants will be playing a game in
where your goal is to reach the top of the screen. 

By the end of the game:
1) All participants will be assigned to either Group 1 or 2.
2) The group that enters the top boundary first (like crossing a finish line) will earn a $9 bonus.
